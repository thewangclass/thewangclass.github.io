Goal/Purpose: To bring aesthetically pleasing
Mission Statement:



Step One: Quantify Your Buyer Personas
- What is the price each buyer is willing to pay?
- What is the estimated Lifetime Value (LTV) of that customer?
- What is the estimated Customer acquisition cost (CAC) of that customer?
- What are the top three marketing channels you're finding this buyer in currently?
- Who does this buyer report to? Who reports to theM?
- Which three features do they care about most? /The least?
- Which value proposition do they care about most? The least?
- Who else needs to approve a purchase (if anyone)?

Step Two: Find The Right Features For Each Persona
- Ask feature questions that force them to make a decision/tradeoffs

Step Three: Determine the best value metric and bundling
- A value metric is what you charge for, and should:
  1. Align to your customer's needs.
  2. Grow with your customer.
  3. Be easy to understand.

Step Four: Actually pricing your product.
- At what point is [your product] so high-price that you'd never consider purchasing it? (At what price would you consider the product to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it? (Too expensive)) 
- At what point is [your product] getting expensive, but you'd still consider purchasing it? (At what price would you consider the product to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn’t be very good? (Too cheap))
- At what point is [your product] a really great deal? (At what price would you consider the product starting to get expensive, so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it? (Expensive/High Side))
- At what point is [your product] so low-price that you'd question the quality of it? (At what price would you consider the product to be a bargain—a great buy for the money? (Cheap/Good Value))

Ask the Customer - The Price Intelligently Method
- Force respondents to simply choose a favorite feature and least favorite feature gives you a better opportunity to hone in on the aspects of your offering that are most attractive to customers.

Price Sensitivity - a measure of the impact of price points on consumer purchasing behaviors. Price sensitivity measures the percentage of sales you will lose or gain at any particular price point relative to another lower or higher price point. 


Good - Better - Best Pricing (Tiered Pricing)
- Offensive: Plays aimed at generating new growth and revenue
- Defensive: Counter or forestall moves by competitors
- Behavioral: Draw on principles of consumer psychology
"Fence" Attribute - a feature that constitutes a barrier preventing existing customers from crossing over to something cheaper
- Don't want someone to go from best > better > good
High appeal/low-cost best features are often less about the actual product and more about the customer experience.
Rule of thumb: no more than four attributes should differ between Good and Better and between Better and Best. 
Important to maintain a consistent progression of benefits from Good to Best.
Advise setting a Good price that's more than 25% below Better.
Advise the Best price should not exceed Better by more than 50%.
