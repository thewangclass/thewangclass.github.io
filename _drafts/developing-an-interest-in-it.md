My interest in the field of IT began almost 4 years ago in my current job as a Computer Science teacher.

It was my first year teaching computer science, and I wanted to test a lot of programs for my class. I didn't have my own computer at this point in time - I didn't build one until 11/2018 - so I had to use the school provided laptop. It's a pretty great laptop, powerful enough to run most applications a teacher would need; the only caveat was I did not have administrative privileges. This makes total sense - most teachers don't need to be downloading software and testing things out. Heck, most computer science teachers don't even go around doing that. However, I wanted to try new software out and test new curriculum and other things I could do in my classroom.  

I would essentially be at the IT station every other week or so asking for help installing software. This is before they implemented the ticket system (which I utilize heavily nowadays and highly enjoy using). Eventually, one of the IT support specialists ended up giving me some elevated privileges for my laptop to allow me to install and run extra software on my laptop.
