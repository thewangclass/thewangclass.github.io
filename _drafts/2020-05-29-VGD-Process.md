Today is the first day of summer 'break'... and I am ready to put some full-time work into further developing my Video Game Design Curriculum for the next school year!

Some backstory on the process:
- Physics to Comp Sci
- Week before, teaching VGD!
- Ask fellow teachers what they're doing. Find resources (books) left behind by previous teacher (fired). Do my own research and buy books online (Bond).
- First year: What I did
- Second year: What I did
- Third year: What I did
- Now: 
1. Coursera Principles of Game Design by UMich
2. Sam Adlis and Kristine Chen collaboration
3. Reading through old VGD and in general game design books
4. Perusing online forums
