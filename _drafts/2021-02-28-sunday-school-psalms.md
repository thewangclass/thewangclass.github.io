What are the questions that our community is asking regarding faith and spirituality? What are the concerns of the community?
Community: college friend group, students/teachers, church

College friend group:
How do I live a life of faith? What does it look like in today's context? As I begin to own my Christianity, how do I interpret the Bible?

Students/teachers:
Identity questions - how can I reconcile God and my own identity - LGBTQA wise? 
How do I support my beliefs when society seems to be trending away from Christianity?

Church:
What does it mean to be a church as in Acts? To be a church on a mission? How do we derive community from each other, support one another, and serve (both in/outside of the church)?
How does our english congregation fit in with the larger Swuh church as a whole? 



Praise be to your name, oh God.
Praise be to your name.

For your hand has been on my life even before I was born.
From the stories of my father and mother, you have woven
An intergenerational testament to your glory.

When I was doubting and walked away,
You, Lord, sought me. 
When I was confused, worried, uncertain,
You, Lord, comforted me.

When I didn't know where else to turn,
You, Lord, held me,
And gave me peace.
May I remain in your steadfast presence forever.

And as I grow and become independent,
May I be reminded of your presence and your grace.
As I grow old and my bones begin to ache,
May I remain faithful to you, my God.

Though time and people change.
You, Lord, never change. 
I will be reminded of your steadfast presence, forever.

So when the enemy casts doubt, 
And false prophets lead the day,
May
