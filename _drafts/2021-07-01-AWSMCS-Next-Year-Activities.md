Things To Look Forward To Next Year
@ My School
- Physically going to 9th grade and 10th grade classrooms to advertise - not sure about going to all-girl locations? Maybe intimidated. 
Algebra 1, Geometry - all
- Having a tour day - did previously, can testify only one 9th grade girl came as a result of that (because of a bongo cat program) and she's continuing on.
- Continue to email teachers - expand my email list - for students they would recommend.
- Making a video to send to 8th grade teachers/counselors to showcase CS? Showcase 9th/10th graders they would know. Showcase Independent Study projects. Showcase artwork around classroom.

@ District Wide
- Learning how to partner with other people in district to be CS advocate (make myself known as the CS person to people in the district). Partnering with local universities to do hackathons (UT Dallas and Richardson HS) and high school camps would be amazing. I think this would be great to talk about in Fall. 
- More of a leader amongst other CS teachers - longest 'tenured' - have more voice in determining culture amongst CS teachers and where we're heading/what we focus on.


Send pictures to Brandon and describe thought process behind room setup.
Thought process behind room creation: 
- There is no 'front' of the classroom. There is no 'back' of the classroom. Circular tables.
- Whiteboards for students to work together and work out pseudocode, explain thought process to each other
- Sofa for hanging out, lounging around, building a sense of 'community' amongst students. This is coming from my 4-year orchestra background and thinking about what helped contribute to the atmosphere I felt there.
- 
- Moveable TV, able to connect to via Internet, Independent Study students can use to to display their projects and give a presentation.


Kinks:
- TV did not really work with Internet connections
