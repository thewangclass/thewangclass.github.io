What are some common business mistaskes entrepreneurs make in the creative business field?
- Get paid up front.
  50%, 25% three-quarters of the way in, 25% upon delivery (or within 30 days and then after you add interest)

- How do you effectively communicate with business partners. How do you negotiate fair terms? How do you sell your company/service w/o much experience to show?
  Might have someone be the 'hunter'. Just out there getting leads, making connections.
  Might have someone be the 'closer'. The one with the details, finalizing things, getting the contract.
  Be upfront: we're willing to give you a try for 7 days, but we have to let you know this isn't stable [insert other truth here].
  Give them a way out: let them leave with their pride intact. 
  Selling your company/service is all confidence. Maybe some portfolio.  

- How do you bid? How do you budget for unexpected things that go wrong in a project?
  Not hourly. 
  How much would you have to pay someone else to do that job?
  If they were to call you, how much dread would you feel if you were to pick up the phone? 

- How do you prevent your business from crashing & burning in the first year? Getting off the Runway.
  Line of credit with your bank.
  Run lean. Be like in college. Keep expenses down. Live within your means.

- How do I establish good company culture?
  What values are important to you as a person? What attracted you to a previous job/place?
  Applicants look at everything. 
    How much am I getting paid? How good is the work I am doing? How do they treat me? How do they manage the company?
    Probably can't compete on price/quality of the work. Focus on how you treat them, how you manage projects.
  I want to make sure their long-term career is protected and nourished. Don't have a recipe for burning people out.
