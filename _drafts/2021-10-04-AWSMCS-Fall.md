Interventions: 
Personal recruitment (library, cafeteria)
email other teachers for recommendations and ask them to talk
new classroom that looks awesome, visible
bonus points for competitions/involving other teachers
instructional strategies to increase the success of students: quiz is 3 times, no reason should not get 100, self/buddy/IDE or myself!
collaboration, work together! just make sure you learn

personal didn't work so much for me? maybe time of year

Good idea - maybe make these things they can check off because it's in December (very timely panel topic) and students sign up in January/February (make it as easy for teachers to do something as possible)
Lowering the barrier to getting teacher's to act. 
Lowering barrier to counselors, dispelling myth of who should take computer science.
