THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE INTERESTED AND A GOOD CANDIDATE

My Questions:
Is this a remote position?

What does a typical day in the life of a data analyst (III) look like?

What skills are you looking for?
- I notice the job posting mentions troubleshooting exisiting SAS programs and PowerBI.

I notice on the posting it says "The analyst works under general supervision with limited latitude for the use of initiative and independent judgment". Does this mean there is little freedom in exploring avenues/rabbit holes/other possible paths? Am I understanding this correctly?
- What are the biggest challenges that someone in this role would face?

What does the rest of the team look like? Other roles?


Why is the position open? Is this a new position or are you replacing someone?



A little about myself: 
- 

When are you looking to hire?
- I don't want to contribute to the teacher shortage. 
- This is place I grew up in.
- Is it possible to do part time now, full time when summer hits? Is that something we could work out if I am the best candidate?


What is your onboarding like? If I work remotely...

What are the performance expectations of this position over the first 3 months? What metrics/goals will I be evaluated against?


How long have you been working here? What is your favorite thing about working here?

My Responses:
Why do you want to leave the classroom?
There are a couple of things that come to mind when I decided to apply for this position.
- Remote work. Hour commute time
- Future, baby, work from home
- Covid-19
- I don't really want to leave the classroom - I want to give back to my colleagues, to my administration, to my role - and leaving the classroom and stepping into this role is a great way to do so

Why do you think you are a good candidate?
- I am a teacher. There is no one who gets teachers like a fellow teacher.
- I am a CTE teacher, someone who could make more money in the workforce as a computer scientist. I am also aware of the lack of computer science teachers in Texas and our attempts to recruit more. I am interested in looking at a pathway to enabling earning higher salaries. 
- I have extensive programming experience. I have taught it to high school, and college undergraduate students. My experience with Python and R and their data visualization packages are transferable. 
- I can break a problem down into smaller chunks. I can turn those chunks into a timeline where I make deliverables. I can work within the confines of a deadline and constraints. 
- I take ownership of learning more and teaching myself - that's what teachers do, and that's what I do. See: Network/Security+ exams, taking R and Python courses.
- I believe that all students can achieve at high levels. This is in my track record as a teacher, advancing CS for all.


Why do you want to work for TEA?
- In my current role, I know the limits of what a teacher can do.
- As the supervising board of education in Texas, I think working for the TEA will give me the platform to tackle problems I currently cannot tackle. I believe working for the TEA, specifically this data analyst role, will help me enact data-driven change. 

What is your experience with analyzing data?
- With my CS teacher team in the district. Looking at our formative assessments.
- With EPIC at TACC with Carol Fletcher, looking at research-backed ways to increase female enrollment in computer science.
- Something I started 2 years ago before pandemic (before working with EPIC/TACC) - created a list of top performing CS schools in Texas that are similar to my school. I did this by looking at lists of schools with similar demographics - I got this from TEA I believe, as well as schools that did well in CS competitions and then cross-referenced them. And then the pandemic hit. I thought it would be too much work for teachers who were already scrambling to get their lessons online to respond to my emails so I shelved the project and I have not gotten back to it.
