title: "How I Became A Teacher"
---

> *"How did I end up a teacher?"*

Sometimes I have this thought. It might be reflecting back on the school year and thinking over the many events, pondering if I could see myself continuing along this path; other times it is like right now, when I eagerly anticipate the coming school year and wondering about what the school year will bring and how I can best teach and reach my students; and perhaps during the school year when I have bad days, and good days, and days where I can only reply "That's above my pay grade." Maybe it's when I think about my own culture and what *"asians"* value.  

tl;dr it's random  

But I **_have_** thought long and hard about it in my head, and yet I've never written it into being. So here's an attempt.  

---  

All of my asian friends' parents are doctors.

This statement was something my naive elementary-school-grade self believed. I grew up on the island of Galveston, TX and attended a chinese church there where many of the congregation, like my parents, worked at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). So it could have been true, all my asian friends could have had parents that were doctors - but alas it was not. To my young self, working in medicine meant being a doctor. It was not until much later I learned about nurses and therapists and other medical occupations.  

Anyways, I had this conceived notion that I wanted to become a doctor when I was little. A pathologist like my dad in fact. It wasn't that my parents ever pressured me into becoming a doctor - I have no recollection of my parents ever directing or insisting on my path towards medicine like I heard many of my peers complain about. I was intrinsically motivated to become one.  

There's more that can be said about growing up in a very diverse daycare (William Temple), having a fairly diverse friend group in elementary school (Trey Orange, Carlos Rodriguez, Daniel Du, Shamis Khan), going to a magnet middle school and joining orchestra and having for the first time in my life a majority asian friend group (Westbrook Intermediate), and then attending high school and being a first generation American high school student and navigating those waters (what are AP classes, what is GPA, what is the SAT, etc.). Those are for another time. 

Fast forward to applying for college. I decided to apply for a biomedical engineering major because 1) I was interested in pursuing medicine; 2) I wanted the possibility of pursuing a career in biomedical engineering (whatever that meant to my high school self); and 3) I didn't want just the knowledge/theory in college without being able to put it in practice - I believed the engineering portion would allow me to create and make and test the material I was learning. I decided to go to UT Austin and entered as a freshman in Fall 2012.

Fast-forward. I took OChem and PChem, Genetics and various labs, and took care of the majority - if not all - of my premed requirements by the end of freshman year. I also was able to help with some research under a graduate student. This research experience made me realize I could not do graduate school for biomedical engineering. The sheer number of hours of data collection, setting up and tearing down experiments, applying for grants and writing papers - it was not something I looked forward to. 

The summer after my freshman year, I shadowed a cardiologist near where I grew up. I watched as he spent but the briefest of moments with each patient, barely taking any time to make conversation and only making his rounds. I don't fault him for it - I don't know the demands of cardiologists and how many patients he had to see (he had to commute between two different hospitals) - but it was far different from the picture painted by the books I read as a kid (looking at you The Christmas Shoes and My Sister's Keeper). Based on this perception of working as a physician, I decided I did not want to become one. 

Now I had a conundrum, what career path to follow? Becoming a doctor, pursuing a graduate degree, both of these were no longer options for me. One option was left - entering the industry with a bachelors degree, which wasn't ideal for a biomedical engineer. It was this time, Fall of my Sophomore year, when I found out one of my friends was taking a teaching class through the UTeach program. I thought, "Why not?" and signed up for the class with them. Wow - what a blast. Besides a not-so-great teaching partner, I had a blast learning about the theory of how people learn, teaching elementary schoolers, and the great community. I took the next course, then the next, then the next, and by the end of junior year I was strongly considering going into teaching after I retired from a career in engineering.
