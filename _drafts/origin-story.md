# My Origin Story

One thing I should mention is we lived very close to UTMB. I remember going on walks in the park, going to the beach, and most of all my grandparents taking care of me. My parents tell me I didn't talk until I was 3 years old. They were worried about me because apparently babies talk earlier. However, I may have just been confused because I heard the Shandong dialect from my grandparents, English from others, and Chinese from still others.

My next memory is of going to William Temple preschool, where I quickly made friends with others in this daycare. The daycare people loved me and I really enjoyed my time there. I obtained a GameBoy at some point in time and quickly made a name for myself with my Yellow version and Silver version. I remember spending countless hours playing Pokemon, helping train other peoples' pokemon, and playing more Pokemon to the point where I could go through the entire cave between Cerulean city and Celadon city without Flash. Greatest accomplishment of that time. 

Sometime later we moved across the island to the west side where I started Kindergarten at Oppe Elementary. We lived literally one block away from Seawall and the beach, and we spent many days on the sand. I remember one time going crabbing with my family and when we ate the crabs, they were full of sand. Obviously we hadn't cleaned them properly, it was our first time crabbing I think and so we didn't know better, but I still have fond memories of that time. I don't think we ever went crabbing again after that.

Sometime in my elementary school years, we visited my extended family in China. I honestly don't remember too much, but I'll share some snapshots of things I do recall. I remember visiting my dad's family and being on the farm. My dad grew up as a farmer, not even the oldest, and was the first in his entire village to go to college. Which is remarkable in and of itself - my dad is not the oldest boy in his family, so theoretically his older brother should have been the one to go to school. However his older brother gave the opportunity to my dad. Anyways, we were eating cooked snails and I remember it being quite good. I was enjoying myself until my dad passed me a huge snail. I bit into it only to retch in disgust as it was full of sand. That was the last one I tried. I also remember an outhouse and having to relieve myself in a hole.
We visited my mom's side as well. I remember my older uncle having a motorcycle, my middle uncle faintly, and my young uncle giving us a ton of mango juice. I also remember one time my family was going to go out but I didn't want to go so they left me with a cousin. I think I napped for a bit but then grew worried when they didn't come back. I think I was worried about being abandoned at this point in time. 

I started piano lesson around the age of 5. Mrs. Ray was my teacher and we had concerts. 

Other memories from K-2. Going to afterschool YMCA program. Mrs. Human Yellow class, Mrs. Lively 2nd grade and winning Around-the-World Multiplication tournaments so often (and hogging the prizes) that she made me hold up the flash cards for other students. Volleyball in gym class. Tag, freeze tag. Fastest kids along with Gary. Andrew Liu and asthma. 

What else?

In 4th grade we were separated into Red, White, and Blue group. Differentiation? I don't recall exactly what the criteria for each group was, but I do remember the consensus among the students was that Blue group was the 'smart' group. I remember 1 minute math drills. Having 3 teachers I switched between.

What else?

I remember going to Rosenburg library and participating in their summer reading programs. Honestly, I am so grateful because it instilled in me a lifelong love of reading. Library reading programs work!!! Especially the bingo things where I had to read different genres.

I remember biking extensively on the west side of Galveston. To and from school. And then in 3rd/4th grade, I stopped going to YMCA after school care in the cafeteria. I think my mom either started picking me up from school or I started biking to and from school. And then I biked to and from my friend's place in Campeche Cove. I brought my sister along once, but then the cars honked at us on the road and my sister got scared and started crying so she headed back. I went back after her. 

I remember in 3rd grade, getting valentine cards for everyone in my homeroom class. However I didn't sign any of it. And so when everyone opened their bags of valentines everyone was like "oooh I have a secret admirer!" and was wondering who it was. They deduced it was me or this other kid because we were the only ones that didn't 'give' any cards. I threw the other guy on the other bus. 

I remember calling the cops on my parents once, because I was super angry with them. But after I dialed and I heard someone, I quickly hung up because I was scared and realized what I was doing. In my little kid brain hanging up was the end of things, but then later there was a knock on the door and the cops actually showed up! My parents talked to them and everything was ok, but I remember feeling embarassed and scared for my parents (not of my parents).

And then I remember 'running away' from home. Running away is in quotations because I literally rode my bike next door to the nearby church parking lot and just stayed there. But then it got dark and I saw my parents' car going down the street looking for me, and a combination of fright and feeling sorry for my family made me go back home. 

I remember the 'dog cage' in the backyard and how my parents threatened with putting us there if we were bad. 

I remember the basketball goal in the backyard, the giant tree.

I remember eating shrimp with my sisters and finishing it, despite there being so much, and my parents being so surprised!

I remember a tropical storm hitting Galveston and just hunkering down.

I remember my dad getting a job as a pathologist in Clear Lake Regional Medical Center and making the daily commute off of Galveston to Webster and back. That's why we eventually moved to League City to be closer to his work.

I remember being upset, afraid to lose all my friends and have to make new ones at my new school. And the endless drives to the home builder to plan and determine what would be the new house.

I went to Bauerschlag Elementary School, home of the Baueschlag Bears. Trudy Knight was the principal. Mrs. Ford, Mrs. Reeves, and Mrs. Galbert were my Math, ELA/SS, and Science teachers respectively. Two of my friends that I knew prior to moving were there - Min Bi and Michelle - both asian. I also made friends with Luyou (her younger brother Sasa was in my sister's grade) and other friends. But most of the time I spent reading. I would get to school, turn in my books, check out two books (max we were allowed to checkout), read during school, turn them in after school and check out two more, and keep reading. There was also something called ARP (accelerating reading points) where you take quizzes over books you read and it would award you a certain number of points. Thinking back, there was also a suggested grade level attached to each book. Anyways, by the end of the school year I had taken over 360 tests and accumulated over 1300 points. I think the highest prize was 400 or so points. They gave me the highest prize twice. 

I started playing violin winter of 5th grade. I had the same teacher as my friend. I tried out for orchestra and made Symphony orchestra, the #2 orchestra. Not bad for only 3-4 months of playing, but I think my piano playing helped me because I already knew how to read music.
